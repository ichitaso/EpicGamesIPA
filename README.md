# Fortnite

## Installation Issues
Fortnite may crash on installation unless you're using **TrollStore or a paid developer certificate**. Due to an Apple limitation that cannot be bypassed.

## How to Install with an Apple Developer Certificate
If you have a certificate, or TrollStore, you should be able to install the IPA directly.

For users with their own paid certificate:
1. Enable the following entitlements:
   - **Extended Virtual Addressing**
   - **Increased Memory Limit**
2. Sign the IPA with your certificate using your preferred signing method.
